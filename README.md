## Errors 
I was doing fine for the most part but then I kept getting errors with using the Digital Ocean console. 

### The console needing to reload 
I pressed the Launch Droplet Console to enter the password but it wouldn't load no matter how much I waited and press enter. I would go into Launch Recovery Console to enter the password.

It took me a while to figure out why the password wasn't working.

### Pink Screen 
When I was installing npm, I would get this screen:

I don't know what it meant by Daemons using outdated libraries but no matter what I pressed, I would be stuck on this screen, I would then have to reset the droplet console progress. 

### An error with nodejs 
After resetting the console, I got this error trying to install nodejs. It worked the first time so I don't know where this error came from so I resetted the droplet all together.

It worked again when I resetted it but I'm still getting an error with the npm install. I don't know what's happening or if it has anything to do with the laptop I'm using.
